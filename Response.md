Ok, here's how you can implement a web application using React and TypeScript that keeps score for dance battles,
allowing judges or observers to input scores based on performance categories such as creativity, technique, and
presentation. The app could tally scores in real-time and display leaderboards for ongoing competitions.

Here's how you can run the project

```
yarn dev
```

This code provides a foundation for a real-time dance battle scoring app, handling score input, tallying, and
leaderboard updates using React and TypeScript.
